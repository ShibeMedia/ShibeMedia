Shibe Media was founded with the goal of promoting honesty and transparency in media through the development of tools that facilitate open collaboration, enable better source traceability, and provide a framework for comprehensive free-knowledge databases. We chose to pilot this initiative within the Dogecoin community, a group that is frequently overlooked by mainstream media. To support the development of these open-source tools and achieve our goal, we created Shibe Magazine, a media publication that utilizes these tools developed by Shibe Media developers. Our aim is not only to provide an alternative to mainstream media, but also to empower others to join us in our mission of creating a more honest and open media environment.
